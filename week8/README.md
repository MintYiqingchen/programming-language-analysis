### Style array (leet.py)
Using Python+numpy, or any other array programming language, implement a program that takes as input an array of characters (the characters from Pride and Prejudice, for example), normalizes them, and replaces all characters with their Leet (Links to an external site.) counterparts. Then it prints out the 5 most frequently occurring 2-grams. (2-grams are all 2 consecutive words in a sequence)


Avoid explicit iteration over the elements of the array. If you find yourself writing an iteration, think of how you could do it with one or more array operations.
